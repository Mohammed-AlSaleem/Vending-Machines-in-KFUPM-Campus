# Vending-Machines-in-KFUPM-Campus
Bachelor Graduation Project

## Introduction:
Students at KFUPM Dorms face problems with food because restaurants at KFUPM mall and University restaurant close early, which make getting food hard and expensive for the students. An easy way to solve this problem and what is our project focus on is by using a vending machine. The process of operating the vending machine has several problems, one of these problems is determining the right place that can serve the largest possible number of people, the second is that finding the best tour to fill the machine with items, and finally determining the appropriate type of vending machine. In our case, the machines will be distributed in the students’ buildings by using the total cover technique to make sure all the students can reach the vending machine in less than 4 minutes,  also the Salesman problem will be applied to find the lowest path to refill the machines. Based on certain criteria the type of vending machines will be selected to ensure that the machine is the best choice.


## Project Goals:
* Provide food and drinks to students all the time.
* The food and drinks have suitable prices.
* The students can get the food and drinks easily and in a short time.
* Provide fresh and healthy food.
* Minimize the required number of vending machines and their cost.
* Finding the best locations for the vending machines.
* Finding the best way to refill the vending machines.
* Finding the best type of vending machine.


## Solution and Validation:
The solution is divided into three main parts:
* Vending machine’s locations.
* Refill movement.
* Vending machine selection.
